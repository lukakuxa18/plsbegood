Many American wine-drinkers are put off by the word "sweet" but this authentic naturally semi-sweet wine has been making American converts for the last decade. Kindzmarauli is sweet but not too sweet because it is made from a tannic and complex grape varietal, Saperavi. The characteristics of the Saperavi grape lend balance to the sugar resulting in a well structured wine great for pairings.</p></div>
